          <h2>Sales and Use Tax Exemptions</h2>
          <p><span class="bold">ENERGY STAR® Appliances <a href="https://floridarevenue.com/taxes/tips/Documents/TIP_23A01-04.pdf" target="_blank">(Florida Rule 12A-1.045)</a>:</span> Sales of qualifying ENERGY STAR® appliances during designated "sales tax holidays" are exempt from sales and use tax.

        <h2>Additional Considerations</h2>
        <p><span class="bold"><a href="https://floridarevenue.com/property/Pages/Taxpayers_TangiblePersonalProperty.aspx" target="_blank">Tangible Personal Property Tax</a>:</span> While not directly a sales or use tax, it's important to note that solar and renewable energy equipment on commercial property can be subject to the tangible personal property tax.</p>
        <p><span class="bold"><a href="https://www.floridabar.org/the-florida-bar-journal/harvesting-the-sun-a-sustainable-approach-for-floridas-greenbelt-law/" target="_blank">Greenbelt Law</a>:</span> Landowners may be eligible for reductions on property tax assessments through programs like the Greenbelt Law if their land is used for agricultural purposes. This can indirectly benefit solar energy development on agricultural land.</p>

        <h2>Incentives</h2>
        <p><span class="bold">Solar and Renewable Energy Property Tax Exemption <a href="https://floridarevenue.com/taxes/tips/documents/TIP_19A01-09.pdf" target="_blank">(Florida Statute 212.02(26))</a>:</span> Counties or municipalities can choose to offer a property tax exemption for solar and renewable energy source devices in residential, commercial, and industrial properties.
