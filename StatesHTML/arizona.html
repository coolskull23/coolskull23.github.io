          <h2>Sales and Use Taxes</h2>
          <p><span class="bold">Solar and Wind Equipment <a href="https://www.azleg.gov/ars/42/05159.htm" target="_blank">(A.R.S. § 42-5159)</a>:</span> The sale of solar energy devices, wind turbines, and related equipment for residential, commercial, and general public use are exempt from state sales taxes.

        <h2>Property Taxes:</h2>

This can result in a lower valuation of the property for taxation purposes, potentially reducing property tax burdens.</p>
