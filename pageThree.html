          <p>Hydrogen fuel cells rely on hydrogen as a primary energy source. Currently, hydrogen is predominantly produced from natural gas, accounting for approximately three-quarters of global production, which raises concerns about carbon emissions. However, there is growing interest in green hydrogen, produced through water electrolysis powered by renewable energy sources, offering a truly clean hydrogen supply chain.</p>
          <p>Fuel cell technology encompasses various types, including Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cells, Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs), and others, each with specific applications and efficiency profiles. PEM fuel cells, in particular, are notable for their use in transportation and portable applications due to their low operating temperatures and quick start-up times.</p>
