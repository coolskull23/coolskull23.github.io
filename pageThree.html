            <p>Thus, the hydrogen fuel cell extracts energy from hydrogen by an electrochemical process to produce electricity, and hence serves to be a clean alternative to traditionally used energy sources as it only emits water and heat. Such technology is at the cutting edge of the change toward a more sustainable energy future able to decarbonize such challenging sectors as power or heating as well as hard-to-electrify industry.</p>

          <p>The hydrogen fuel cells rely majorly on the source of power, which is hydrogen. At present, hydrogen is majorly produced from natural gas, covering about three-quarters of the global production, and therefore comes with a lot of concerns on the emission of carbon. In any case, green hydrogen produced by means of water electrolysis is definitely the most interesting, given, of course, its powering by renewable energy sources, hence offering a really clean hydrogen supply chain.</p>
          <p>The fuel cell technology, therefore, lies in the Pro-Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cells, Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) and others, which each of them has a variety of applications and efficiencies associated with them. PEM fuel cells are notable for use in these transport as well as portable applications because of their low operating temperatures, as well as their quick start-up times.</p>

          <p>A hydrogen fuel cell has an application scope ranging from supplying electricity for electric vehicles (EV) to the provision of backup power for telecommunications infrastructure. Reports of market analysis by the Department of Energy provide in detail all progress on the development of fuel cell technologies together with their increased penetration into early market applications, indicating their role as a clean energy converter.</p>

          <p>Major challenges that hydrogen fuel cells are expected to face, even though holding a lot of potential, are mostly high production costs especially related to green hydrogen, and a heavy infrastructure rollout for facilities concerned with the production, storage, and distribution of hydrogen. Therefore, IEA's "The Future of Hydrogen" report has identified that focusing policy action and international cooperation on overcoming these barriers are needed to scale up hydrogen supply and demand.</p>

In order to achieve this, however, there must be the overcoming of economic and technical challenges, a drive for innovative spirit, and the support of the development and deployment of clean hydrogen by means of policy frameworks which are coherent.</p>
